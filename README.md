# Behavioral-Health-Physical-Activity
Overview

This is a Power BI project that analyzes Behavioral Health and Physical Activity Patterns among participants over a 10-week period.Using more than 1,000 participant records, this dashboard illustrates changes in MVPA and measures the extent of autonomy, gender, and age on engagement level and behavioral outcomes.

**Key highlights:**

- Average MVPA: 29.21 minutes/day
- Gender gap: On average, males are 12% more active than females.
- Autonomy impact: High-autonomy participants show 20% higher MVPA
- Age effect: MVPA decreases from 42.39 for age 17 to 22.14 for age 20
- Tracked across 3 key timepoints: baseline, week 6, and week 10

The project gives actionable insights to behavioral scientists, healthcare analysts, and wellness program designers that can help explain and improve the rates of activity participation.
Tech Stack
- Tool	-------  Purpose
- Power BI:	-------  Dashboard Design, Data Visualization, DAX Calculations
- Power Query: 	-------  Data cleaning, transformation, and loading
- CSV Files		-------  Primary data source for behavioral metrics
- DAX	 	-------  Calculated measures for MVPA and behavioral trends

**Features**

- Dynamic Filtering: Year, Month, and Gender slicers for instant insights
- Timepoint Comparison: Track MVPA trends across baseline, week 6, and week 10.
- Gender Analytics: Compare male vs female activity participation
- Autonomy Correlation: Find differences in behavior between high- and low-autonomy groups
- Age-Based Trends: Visualize activity decline with age progression
- Modern UI: Clean, green-themed layout of a Power BI dashboard.

**Data Sources**

All these datasets stem from a simulated Behavioral Health Study containing:
* Demographics_Clean.csv – Age, Gender, Participant IDs
* ActivityData_Clean.csv – MVPA records and timepoints
* Questionnaires_Clean.csv – Self-reported wellness and autonomy data
* LikingData_Clean.csv & RecallData_Clean.csv – Behavioral and cognitive metrics
Total Records: 1,050 | Total Fields: 25+ attributes

**Business Problem & Insights**

**Problem:**

Until today, organisations and wellness programmes have struggled to quantify behavioural engagement and understand which psychological or demographic factors drive consistency in physical activity.

**Key Insights from Dashboard:**

- The consistency of activities decreased by 32% from week 6 to week 10.
- High-autonomy participants maintained 5.33 minutes higher MVPA daily.
- Female activity increased 2.5% by week 6, while male engagement fell by 8%.
- Participants aged 19 years demonstrated the best balance, with a MVPA average of 32.86.
- Overall program retention rate: ~68% at week 10.
--------------------
**The Solution the Dashboard Identifies**
The dashboard also identifies behavioral factors that influence physical activity, including:
- Which demographics are most active and consistent?
- How autonomy and motivation drive performance
- Helping target interventions when activity engagement has declined.
- Which age and gender groups need customized wellness programs

The insights could be used by mental health researchers, fitness planners, or any academic institution in the design of more effective behavior-change models.
